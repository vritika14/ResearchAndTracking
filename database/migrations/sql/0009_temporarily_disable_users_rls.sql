-- This migration was generated during debugging but never applied —
-- RLS on users stayed enabled the whole time (confirmed via
-- pg_class.relrowsecurity). Content replaced with a no-op to ensure
-- a future fresh `drizzle-kit migrate` run never accidentally disables
-- RLS on users. See 0010-0012 for the actual, real fixes that followed.
