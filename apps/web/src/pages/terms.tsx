      <LegalSection title="1. About this service">
        <p>
          Research in Motion ("the Service") is a research project- and task-tracking tool for
          research teams: projects, modules, tasks, daily notes, conference submissions and
          pipeline stages, organised within a shared workspace.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. Accounts">
        <p>
          You sign in through your organisation's identity provider (Amazon Cognito). We do not
          store your password — authentication is handled entirely by Cognito. You are
          responsible for keeping your sign-in credentials secure and for activity that happens
          under your account.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. Workspaces and collaborators">
        <p>
          Content you create belongs to a workspace. Workspace owners can invite collaborators by
          email using a secure, single-use acceptance link, and can remove members or delete the
          workspace at any time. Removing a workspace deletes every project, module, task and note
          inside it.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="4. Your content">
        <p>
          You retain ownership of the project, task, module and note content you enter. You're
          responsible for making sure you have the right to store and share anything you upload or
          type into the Service, and for not entering unlawful, infringing, or sensitive content
          that this Service isn't designed to hold (for example, classified research data or
          special-category personal data about third parties).
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="5. Deletion and retention">
        <p>
          Archiving a project or module does not delete it immediately — archived items are kept
          for 14 days so they can be restored, then permanently deleted on an automated schedule.
          After that window, deleted content cannot be recovered.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="6. Availability and changes">
        <p>
          The Service is provided on an "as is" basis, without warranty of uninterrupted
          availability. Features described as upcoming or in-progress in the app are not yet
          available and may change before release.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Termination">
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate access to the Service for accounts that violate these terms
          or applicable law. You may stop using the Service at any time; workspace owners can
          delete their workspace directly from Settings.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="8. Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided without warranties of
          any kind, and its operators are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential
          damages arising from your use of it.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="9. Changes to these terms">
        <p>
          We may update these terms as the Service changes. Continued use of the Service after an
          update means you accept the revised terms.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="10. Contact">
        <p>
          Questions about these terms can be directed to the workspace owner or the team
          maintaining this deployment of the Service.
