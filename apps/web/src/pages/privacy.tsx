      <LegalSection title="1. Overview">
        <p>
          This policy explains what information Research in Motion ("the Service") collects, how
          it's used, and where it's stored. It covers the Service as it exists today — not
          features that are still planned or in progress.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="2. Information we collect">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            Account details from your identity provider (Amazon Cognito): name, email address, and
            a unique account identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            Profile details you add yourself: job title, institution, department, phone number,
            and research interests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content you create: projects, modules, tasks, daily notes, conference submissions,
            pipeline stages, and comments or descriptions attached to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Workspace membership and collaboration data: who owns or collaborates on a project or
            module, and pending email invitations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Basic product-usage events: which pages you visit and a small number of key actions
            (for example, creating a project or completing a task), each tied to your account and
            workspace and timestamped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Error diagnostics: if the interface encounters an unexpected error while you're signed
            in, we record what broke (an error message and a technical stack trace) and which page
            you were on, so it can be fixed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="3. How we use your information">
        <p>
          Your information is used to operate the Service: authenticating you, showing you the
          projects and tasks you have access to, and letting you collaborate with others in your
          workspace. Usage events are used only to show the workspace owner an aggregate summary of
          how the workspace uses the Service (for example, a count of pages visited or actions
          taken) — they are not shared outside the Service, not used for advertising, and not sold.
          We do not currently use any third-party analytics or advertising services.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="4. Where your data is stored">
        <p>
          Data is stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure. Account authentication is handled
          by Amazon Cognito; application data is stored in a managed database; uploaded files are
          stored in object storage. We don't currently store data with any provider outside of
          AWS.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="5. Data retention">
        <p>
          Archiving a project or module keeps it recoverable for 14 days, after which it is
          permanently and automatically deleted. Account and profile data is retained for as long
          as your account is active.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="6. Local storage and cookies">
        <p>
          The Service stores a small number of display preferences directly in your browser —
          things like your chosen color theme, text size, and dashboard layout. These stay on your
          device, are not sent to us, and are only used to remember how you like the interface set
          up.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="7. Your rights and choices">
        <p>
          You can review and update your profile details at any time from Settings. To request a
          copy of your data or its deletion beyond what workspace tools already provide, contact
          the team maintaining this deployment of the Service.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="8. Children's privacy">
        <p>
          The Service is intended for research and academic use by adults and is not directed at
          children.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="9. Changes to this policy">
        <p>
          If what we collect or how we use it changes — for example, if a third-party analytics or
          advertising service is introduced — this page will be updated and the "Last updated" date
          above will change accordingly.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection title="10. Contact">
        <p>
          Questions about this policy can be directed to the workspace owner or the team
          maintaining this deployment of the Service.
